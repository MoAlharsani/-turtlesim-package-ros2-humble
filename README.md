# turtlesim-package-ros2-humble
In this repo, I will build custom controller for the Turtlesim package in the ROS2 Humble distro.

### To-Do

- [ ] Make the turtle draw a shape where the shape is given by a set of points. ${\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)\}}$


### Completed

- [x] Make the turtle navigate to a given (x,y) point.
  - Implemented at the `GoToCoordinate` class
